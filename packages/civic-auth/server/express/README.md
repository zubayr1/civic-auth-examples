# CivicAuth Express Example App

A minimal Express.js application demonstrating integration with **Civic Auth** for user authentication using OAuth 2.0 and PKCE. This example includes endpoints to initiate authentication, handle callbacks, and access protected routes.

## 🚀 Prerequisites

- **Yarn**: Ensure you have _Yarn_ installed.
- **Civic Auth Account**: Obtain your `CLIENT_ID` from the [Civic Auth Dashboard](https://auth.civic.com/dashboard).

## 🛠 Installation

Install Dependencies using _Yarn_

```bash
yarn install
```

## 🔧 Configuration

Create a `.env` file in the root directory and set the following environment variables:

```env
CLIENT_ID=your_civic_auth_client_id
SESSION_SECRET=your_secure_session_secret
```

- **CLIENT_ID**: Your CivicAuth application client ID.
- **SESSION_SECRET**: A secure, random string for signing session cookies.

## 🏃 Running the App

Start the Express server using _Yarn_:

```bash
yarn start
```

The server will start on `http://localhost:3000`.

## 🔍 Usage

Visit `http://localhost:3000/auth/login` to trigger a login process.

Once authenticated, visit `http://localhost:3000/admin/hello`.
